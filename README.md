# ü¶† Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains 5 hands-on machine learning projects developed as part of my AI coursework, showcasing a full pipeline of data-driven problem solving, from data preprocessing to deep learning with CNNs. Projects are built using real-world datasets like IMDb Top 1000 Movies, MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- PCA, KMeans, Logistic Regression, MLPClassifier

## üìÅ Contents

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Some of the output visualisations (especially the ones using plotly) were cleared to save space and make the notebooks visibile directly through GitHub
  - The 3rd notebook may have some rendering issues inside GitHub, so it might not load properly

### `data/imdb_top_1000_cleaned.csv`
  - The data folder contains the cleaned, normalized top 1000 IMDb dataset that I created in notebook 1 and used in notebooks 2 and 3

### 1. üìä Data Preprocessing, Visualisation & Movie Recommendation System
- **Notebook:** `1_data_preprocessing_movie_recommendation_system.py`
- **Goal:** Clean, transform, and visualise IMDb's Top 1000 Movies dataset, make a movie recommendation system
- **Highlights:**
  - Missing value imputation (median, mean, genre-based filling)
  - Outlier detection and clipping using IQR
  - Feature scaling (MinMax, Z-score, log)
  - One-hot encoding and dimensionality reduction
  - Over 10 insightful plots and a cleaned dataset ready for modeling
  - Movie recommendation system based on a given movie, using cosine similarity

### 2. üìà Regression Models
- **Notebook:** `2_regression_models.py`
- **Goal:** Predict movie popularity (`No_of_Votes`) using classical regression models
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Highlights:**
  - Feature selection via correlation analysis
  - Feature engineering: combined actor + director popularity
  - Model evaluation with RMSE, MAE, R¬≤
  - Visual analysis of feature-target relationships

---

### 3. üîç Clustering & Classification
- **Notebook:** `3_clustering_classifiers.py`
- **Goal:** Apply K-Means Clustering and Logistic Regression on IMDb data
- **Highlights:**
  - K-Means clustering with Elbow & Silhouette analysis
  - PCA-based cluster visualization
  - Cluster profiling to identify patterns
  - Logistic Regression on binary popularity label (`Is_Popular`)
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

### 4. üß† Neural Networks (MNIST)
- **Notebook:** `4_neural_networks.py`
- **Goal:** Digit classification using neural networks (MLPClassifier vs. TensorFlow)
- **Highlights:**
  - Data normalization and vectorization
  - Achieved >98% accuracy
  - Trained with various hyperparameters and architectures
  - Confusion matrix + training curves comparison

---

### 5. üñºÔ∏è Convolutional Neural Networks (MNIST & CIFAR-10)
- **Notebook:** `5_convolutional_neural_networks.py`
- **Goal:** Image classification using custom CNNs and AlexNet's architecture
- **Highlights:**
  - Designed and compared 10 CNN architectures
  - Best model: 99.38% test accuracy on MNIST
  - Analysis of training time, accuracy, and model size
  - Used dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation

## üìö Motivation

Each notebook simulates a real-world data science role at *DaciaVision Analytics*, giving business context to each task (e.g., popularity forecasting, cluster profiling, digit recognition). These projects helped me understand a full ML lifecycle and apply concepts from supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning.
